My P5 Projects

Anyone can copy such a simple scripts lmao.

To use a code you need p5.js library!

To make a project work you must:

1) Add a folder named "P5BASICS" containing all the files listed inside "index.html";
2) Add "ImprovedNN.js" file in "P5BASICS" folder;
3) Add "matrix.js" file in "P5BASICS" folder (you can find it here: https://github.com/Ozzev/Toy-Neural-Network-JS/blob/master/lib/matrix.js).
